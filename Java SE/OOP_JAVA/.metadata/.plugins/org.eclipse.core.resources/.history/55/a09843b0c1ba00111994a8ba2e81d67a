Inheritance:
------------


 why we need?
 
   
    --> Re-use common state and behav on specialized classes ( imp ).
    
    --> Extending current system without any complexity.
    
    --> Adding new properties and behav to existing Objects
    
    --> To bring Runtime-Polymorphisn on Objects.
    
    
    
    Types of Inheritace:
    ---------------------
    
    
    a. single-level ( A <--- B )
    b. Multi-level  ( A <--- B <---- C )
    c. Multiple     ( A,B <--- C ) ( Interfaces )
    
    
    In Java
    --------
    
    a. Class-Level Inheritance
    b. Interface-Level Inheritance
    
    
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    terms:
    ------
    
    parent / super / generalized
    
    child / sub / derived / specilized class  
    
    
    ---------------------------------------------
    
     Notes:
     -------
     
     
     --> Every sub-class constructor first line is
         'super()', this will invoke its super class's
         default constructor.
         
     --> To initilize super class's private obj var,
         pass the params through super() from
         sub-class constructor.
         
         
     --> If super class dosent have default cons, then sub-class
         cons must pass the params with super() line.
