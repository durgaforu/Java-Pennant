Interface
-----------

why we need?

   --> To avoid tight-coupling between objects.
   
   --> To provide 100% abstraction of Object to Other.
   
   --> To relate different objects with common behav.
   
   --> For Multiple inheritance in java.

  Imp notes :
  
       --> For interface we cant create Instance but we can
           create reference var.
           
       --> Be default all methods are public,abstract methods.
